# Static DHCP Lease and Static ARP

## A. Installation

I am using python3.8.x. Make sure you have installed pip, [read the pip installataion docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). And also make sure you already in the _static-dhcp-lease-and-static-arp_ directory.

We will use [RouterOS-api](https://pypi.org/project/RouterOS-api/) python library.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start the script by execute the main.py file.
```
python3 main.py
```
